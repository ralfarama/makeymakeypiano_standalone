This is the standard Makey Makey Piano "app", with asset files arranged
so that the directory can be placed on a locally hosted web server
without external Internet connectivity.  All credit for the original
construction of this content goes to Yotam Mann (yotammann.info).

To install, copy the contents of this directory to the top-level document
root directory of your web server.
